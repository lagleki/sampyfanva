It's going to be a storm.
Yaaaawn, I'm going to bed.
Let's go home.
C'mon, what are you waiting for?
I'm trying to hold it!
Ah, this is easy.
Nah, why bother fixing it.
I hope, it's worth doing it.
Gah, I lost all my property.
Interesting, all Lojbanists are smart people.
Hm, what is the reason?
It's none of my business that you live with a boy.
You married a stranger, it's none of my business, I'd avoid this topic.
Yuck, that smells like shit! I'm not going to eat this.
I'm going to visit you.
I'm indecisive to whether I should go to a shop.
I didn't mean to hit you.
I'd like some tea, please.
You prepare the food or not ... I don't have any preferences.
I don't want you to leave.
You may come in.

Sing!
Let me see.
Will you pass the juice, please?
Here, take some candies.
Let's try.
Let's go.
You'd better not step onto the bridge.
You should be sleeping now.
You ought to know.
You needn't hide yourself.
Okay, I will wait.
Well, I'm not an expert.
No, the solution doesn't satisfy me, it should be different.
Very good! You did an important work.
Well, okay, you arrived on time.
Oy, you are late.
You are sad, I know that feeling, bro.
It's your problems, I'm not doing your work.
Ah, you're a true friend.
Mmm, you are always lucky.
Greetings, old friend.
Yes, these apples are sweet.
It's some hotel.
I believe that's correct.
I see an owner of what I believe to be a blue house.
Allegedly, he is the murderer.
I don't believe, he is frank with me.
Yes, Alice could be here.
No, I don't agree that the animal is dead.
Eek, there is someone coming!
The water won't reach us.
This way, Sir!
Get your asses over here!
I'd love to stay.
You didn't help me, hate you!
I hate chocolate.
Now I am able to swim.
It was just my duty, so I helped.
What a shame, Alice is not ready yet.
Oops, I mailed to a wrong address.
I'll go with you to see the doctor.
Dear, I don't know.
Leave me alone, I'm thinking.
Be careful, a car ahead!
Go ahead, attack!
Patience, try again!
Ok, what was your motive to do it?
Where is the mother after all?
Phew, the storm is over.

Sorry, I made a mistake.
Wow, these berries are indeed tasty.
Huh, what's the meaning of your words?
Oh, the pen is inside the box.
Hey, you are already here!
Well, no surprises, you are still sleeping.
Everything is perfect, just as I expected.

Then, you must be an American.
So, you don't like beer.
Alice has an opinion that the man is crazy, and it is so, I say.
Everything should be doubted.
We know that most people hate something.
I think you are right.
I think it's worth asking.
I presume, I am a bit ill.
I have a feeling you will succeed.
It seems, she hates you.
It seems, the teacher was disappointed.
Alice, which is my wife, hates beer. And that shows that all women hate beer.
I like women ... Alice in particular.

She is said to be a good doctor.
Oh, what a nice weather.

The student literally never understood my explanations.
The Earth is big, to put it mildly.
I could be rich.
I do live on an island.
I could teach you some additional things.
At least you didn't steal anything.
Hopefully, I'll be given an expensive car or at least one that isn't broken.
Luckily, I'm allowed to wear a short skirt.
You are now at home, lucky you.
Unluckily, this thing wouldn't be of big help.
Unluckily, no one noticed that she was no longer with us.
Truly, you are a smart person.
This &quot;garden&quot; (which is in fact not a garden) is owed by some weird people.
Are you with us? No.
I repeat, I don't agree with you.
Furthermore, I live not in a city.
Probably, this is the most popular one.
Probably, it's the explanation.
It's improbable that Kevin can convince Alice.
You are clearly worried.
Clearly, nothing in their relations was amiss.
Of course, I have never been to Antarctica.
Weather depends on the sun, I see, but it's complicated.

I wasn't sure how many people were present.
Kevin is the first. Eduard is the second, and so on.

&quot;What do you think of pelmeni?&quot; &quot;Nothing, I don't know this word.&quot;
You are asking of what is the reason for something happening in the future, and/or in usage. What is that reason, and is it for something happening in the future, a usage, or both?

A hungry bear will eat even insects.
However, I don't have money.

How do you feel?
Feelings apart, I'm healthy.
No rejoicing from me, you succeded.
Yum, yum, it's tasty.
I'm afraid it can be expensive.
No, not that it requires physical work, but I'm afraid I might not put the box correctly.
Boy, you are hot, I love you.
You are pretty, not that I love you in sexual sense.
Yay, you are with me, my buddy.
Hehe, not that funny, tell me another story.
Yay, you brought the two kittens whom I wanted.
Ha-ha-ha, so funny, I can't laugh anymore, I might fall down to the floor now.
I know it hurts, baby!
You won, yay you!
You must be sad, your dog died.
I can easily climb the mountain, I can go for it!
Yay, that was hard but now I'm at the edge of the city.
What do you need, you beggar?
I'm talking to you, my peers.
Please, governor, help us, worthless people.
You must have thought of something.
Maybe, he is doing it for her, I'm not sure.
Are such words used? I have no idea!

Okay, okay, I understand that I have to sit here.
Ah, I lost my keys.
Mmm, it hurts.
The child played by himself.
The infant walks but not by himself.

It's my virtue, I agree that the city should be destroyed.
My sin, I don't want you to leave.
Yay, I ate a candy that I had stolen.
Yes, of course, you know better (sarcastically)!
With full sincerity, I can tell you that you worked enough.

Let's throw Kevin into this hole (kidding ...).
I might be able to jump from the hill.
Seriously, you are annoying.
Well, my cat has given birth to ten kittens.
&quot;I bought granate.&quot; &quot;Huh, granate?&quot;

Either you or I die!
Let's go!
Let him eat the fruit!
Let your plan be successful!
Did you know?
Didn't you know?
